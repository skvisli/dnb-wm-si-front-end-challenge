# DNB WM S&I Web Tech Front-End Challenge

This repository contains an incomplete web application that allows users to manage list of transactions.

## Dependencies

This application has the following dependencies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - A software packaging system developed for the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment.

## Tasks

Help us improve this application by completing the following tasks:

1. Improve the user experience and make the UI look nicer.

2. Create the UI and logic necessary for users to sort the list of transactions by:
    - Transaction date descending (default)
    - Transaction date ascending
    - Transaction name descending
    - Transaction name ascending

3. Create the UI and logic necessary for users to edit the name of the transaction.

4. Create the UI and logic for users to add a new transaction to the list.

5. (Optional) Bonus points: Improve test coverage using [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

## Getting Started

1. Install all dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Start development: `yarn start`
